# Personal Aim
I wanted to have a focus on CSS.

# Usecase
-Your younger siblings or kids are arguing non stop over who is the strongest, Wolverine or Batman? Spiderman or Thanos? Well now you can have your answer.

Simply select two fighters and make them fight to see who the winner is!

1) Clarified the idea and used figma to create some mockups
2) Map out workflow and divided task into trello actions
3) Aimed for MVP done by Wed. night so I would have time to work on CSS.
4) After getting to MVP I was able to start working on the design of my site.
